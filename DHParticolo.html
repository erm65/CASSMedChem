    <h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
    <h2>DIHYDROPYRIDINES </h2>
    <p>Drugs able to bind the L-type voltage gated channel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Drugs that exert allosteric modulation (the side wall of the PD,
          between subunit three and four)</h4>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Nifedipine" target="_blank">Nifedipine</a>
        ( antagoinist, no chirality so is used as structural reference)</li>
      <li><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Bay-K-8644" target="_blank">Bay-8644</a>
        (R-enantiomer is an antagonist; S-enantiomer in an agonist but at high
        concentartions became an agonist)</li>
      <li><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Amlodipine" target="_blank">Amlodipine</a>
        (antagoinst, pH dependent efficacy)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Drugs that directly block the pore domain </h4>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Benzothiazepines (<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Diltiazem"
          target="_blank">Diltiazem</a>)</li>
      <li>Phenylakylamines (<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Verapamil"
          target="_blank">Verapamil</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>A structure without the ligand is used as reference to track the
      conformational changes due to the binding of SBK or RBK</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When <strong>SBK</strong> enter in the binding site it cause the
        rotation of the<strong><span style="color: red;"> Glutammate 939</span></strong>
        that allow the formation of the fundamental hydrogen bond between the
        side chain of the tyrosine and the ester group of the SBK (point
        mutations on <strong><span style="color: #33cc00;">Tyr1048</span></strong>
        reduce the affinity of DHPs for the protein)</li>
      <li>Differences between enantiomers<strong>:RBK</strong>:&nbsp; CF3-
        substituted phenyl ring of the RBK projects on the hydrofobic pocket
        formed by <strong><span style="color: red;">Valine 932, Threonine 935</span></strong>
        and <strong style="color: #ffcc33;">Phenilalanine 1060</strong><span style="color: #ffcc33;"><span
            style="color: black;">; the C3-ester of RBK&nbsp; is postioned on
            the hydorofobic pocket mad up of Met1366, Val932, Phe 1060; while in
            SBK this place is occupied by the more polar nitro group</span></span></li>
      <li><strong>Amlodipine</strong>: the ethanolamine group form a hydrogen
        bond with the -OH of the Serine 1011. The positive charge of the
        etanholamine group (at the physiological pH of 7,4) confer a different
        binding kinetics that give to the drug the enhanced potency that allow
        once-a-day administration. Also the interaction of a phospholipid (PE
        that appear to directly coordinate the amlodipine (the phosphate of the
        lipid interact with the ethanolamine) but is still unclear how a
        phospholipid can enter the pore domain in an intact membrane (so there
        are doubts that this interaction happen also in vivo). The other
        interactions, such as the hydrogen bonds between the C3 ester and the <strong><span
            style="color: #33cc00;">Tyr1048</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: red;">Gln939</span></strong></li>
    </ul>
